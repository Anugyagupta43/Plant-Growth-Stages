# 🌱 Predicting Plant Growth Stages with Power BI

This project uses environmental and management data to predict plant growth milestones through interactive dashboards built in **Power BI**. The goal is to uncover patterns and optimal conditions that enhance crop yields and support sustainable agricultural practices.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Agricultural companies often face inconsistent plant growth due to varying environmental and resource conditions. This project aims to analyze a dataset containing features like:

- 🌍 Soil Type  
- 🌞 Sunlight Hours  
- 💧 Watering Frequency  
- 🧪 Fertilizer Type  
- 🌡️ Temperature  
- 💨 Humidity  

By exploring how these factors influence plant development, we derive data-driven insights for better decision-making.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** (Decomposition Trees, DAX, Pie Charts, KPI Cards, Bar/Column Graphs)  
- **Excel** (Initial data cleaning + verification)  
- **Data Modeling** using calculated columns and measures  
- **Dashboard Design** focused on insight discovery

- **Decomposition Tree**: Identifies combinations of variables (e.g., soil + watering frequency) that lead to highest growth.
- **Fertilizer Analysis**: Organic fertilizers showed the highest growth milestone count (39.58%).
- **Environmental Conditions**: Optimal ranges for humidity (50–70%) and temperature (20–30°C) maximize plant development.
- **Growth by Soil Type**: Loam soil paired with daily watering and moderate sun consistently outperformed other conditions.

- **Report Summary**: Clay had the highest sunlight exposure; moderate humidity and temperatures boosted growth by 260% over less ideal conditions.
- **KPI Cards**: Sunlight, humidity, and temperature averages offer quick-glance metrics to support real-time farm monitoring decisions.
